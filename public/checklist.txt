# Deployment Checklist for kelalgateway.et

## Files to Upload to httpdocs

1. index.html (main redirect file)
2. welcome.html (landing page)
3. PhoneRegistration.html (step 1)
4. Register.html (step 2)
5. ProfileSetup.html (step 3)
6. RegistrationSuccess.html (success page)
7. test-supabase.html (database test)
8. .htaccess (server configuration)
9. robots.txt (search engine instructions)
10. sitemap.xml (site structure for search engines)
11. css/styles.css (stylesheet)

## Server Configuration

1. Ensure HTTPS is enabled in your hosting control panel
2. Check that the domain DNS is properly configured
3. Verify that the .htaccess file is being processed (AllowOverride All should be set)
4. Make sure PHP is enabled if your hosting requires it

## Common Issues

1. "Site can't be reached" - DNS issue, check domain configuration in PLESK
2. "Not Secure" - SSL certificate is missing, enable HTTPS in PLESK
3. Redirect not working - Check .htaccess permissions (644) and ensure mod_rewrite is enabled
4. Database connection failing - Check Supabase credentials and network connectivity

## Testing Steps

1. Visit https://kelalgateway.et/ - should redirect to welcome.html
2. Click "Test Database Connection" - verify Supabase connection works
3. Complete the registration flow - check data appears in Supabase
